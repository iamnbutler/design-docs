### Version 2.0

There is no "right way" to find your path in the industry. The world of digital product design is still rapidly evolving and has come a long way, even in the past five years. The exciting part is you are on your way to joining an industry with a tremendous amount of impact on people's day-to-day lives–It's up to you to make it for better and not for worse.

Together, we'll outline some common paths, roles, and the way they interact. However, never feel like you must follow a path anyone lays out for you. One of the most magical things about design and the digital world is that you can always forge your own way, and there are some exciting corners to find.

## The Project

This is an ongoing project to help early career designers bootstrap their up to their first job in the tech industry. The goal is to be complete without being overly verbose.

I generally want to bias towards giving direction without being overly opinionated. There are infinite paths, tools and opinions out there, and I hope having a clearly outlined example of an early path will be helpful to some.
