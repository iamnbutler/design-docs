## Design roles

Before we dive in on what you need to secure your first job in the industry, let's look at the roles that exist for designers and how their day-to-day looks.

While these won't be definitive introductions to each role, they should give you an initial understanding. An excellent way to get a further feel for each role is to look at job postings on places like design job boards and Linkedin. You can also find designers with those titles and look at the types of work they have in their portfolios.
