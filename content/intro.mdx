There is no "right way" to find your path in the design industry. The world of digital product design is still rapidly evolving and has come a long way, even in the past five years. The exciting part is you are on your way to joining an industry with a tremendous amount of impact on people's day-to-day livesâ€“It's up to you to make it for better and not for worse.

Together, we'll outline some common paths, roles, and the way they interact. However, never feel like you must follow a path anyone lays out for you. One of the most magical things about design and the digital world is that you can always forge your own way, and there are some exciting corners to find.

## Welcome to the tech industry, friends & future coworkers!

Hey, I'm Nate ðŸ‘‹

I've been designing apps and websites for the past ten years.

I'm excited to share this with you all. I excited to help designers new to the industry jump in, level up, and hopefully avoid some of the pitfalls I did early as a designer.

I've tried to include many things I've learned over the years that I wish I had known when I started designing.

I built this site so you all can return to it for reference as you begin the first steps of your design journey.
