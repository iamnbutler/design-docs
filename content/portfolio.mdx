Your online portfolio is a window into who you are as a designer, _and the work you want to do._

## Don't over-invest in your website

Your portfolio doesn't have to be unique or ornate, as long as it acts as an effective vehicle to share your work.

A common mistake designers just coming out of school make is spending far too much time creating a portfolio with hardly any work in it.

Try spending no more than a week on your first portfolio, and check in on how you are investing your time by roughly using a 1:4 ratio of time spent building your portfolio to working on projects.

Your portfolio will be with you for a long time, and you will end up changing it frequently. It's ok to invest time in a portfolio website but only do so once you are **sure** you have at least three strong projects to show.

## The Basics

- Minimum **three** projects. It's far better to have a basic site with strong projects than a beautiful custom site with a few weak projects.
- Have **one** project you can talk about for **30 minutes**.
  - What was the problem?
  - How did you arrive at the solution you did?
  - What did you do, and who else contributed?
  - How much better was the solution?
- Showcase your organizational skills, collaboration, and a good design foundation.
- Don't put work in your portfolio that you wouldn't want someone to hire you to make. If you want to be a web designer, don't put two print design projects in your portfolio.

## Jumpstart Your Portfolio

If you are feeling overwhelmed on where to start, below is a guide to get started with the simplest (yet still effective!) portfolio.

1.  Create a [read.cv](https://read.cv/explore). This can act as both an initial portfolio and an online resume.
2.  [Read this](https://vanschneider.com/blog/portfolio-tips/write-project-case-studies-portfolio/), then write up the projects you have, up to three.
3.  Try to keep each under 750 words (around ~5 minutes of reading.) Have a summary of the project right at the top.
4.  Each time you finish a project, do a quick write-up while it is fresh in your mind. Before long, you will have a ton of work to share when you create a complete portfolio site.

[Andy Chung's](https://read.cv/andy) cv is a great example to start from. [This project](https://read.cv/andy/X2KMqw0jLQhaeavZHPK5) is around the length you are going for.
