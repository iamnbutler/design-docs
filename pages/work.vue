    <h2>Have work to show</h2>
    <h3>Develop your projects further</h3>
    <p>
      It is ok (and encouraged!) to expand on the projects you do in school.
      Consider using what you did for your class as an outline, and work through
      your favorite project again in your personal time, armed with all the
      knowledge of what went well and what didn't the first time.
    </p>
    <h3>Make something new</h3>
    <p>
      When you start working on projects for your portfolio (or even just for yourself), think about if you would rather invest your time in updating a project you have already started, or making something new. Julie talks about how to find meaningful projects to work in in her aptly named <a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/finding-ideas-d9c07ca1a076">Finding Ideas</a>.
    </p>
    <p>If you find dreading updating a project you've already worked on, consider what excites you at the moment and create something around that.</p>
    <h3>Don't use placeholder content in your designs</h3>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum and real content have a vastly different feel, and people will
      notice this. When you use real content (text, images, profile photos and
      more) you will often find that it behaves differently than placeholder
      content like lorem ipsum or example avatar libraries.

      <p>
        When I'm designing screens, I write content for any words on the page
        (it doesn't have to be really good!)
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      If you need content for a long passage, try using open content found
      online or text from a copyright free book.
    </p>
    <h3>Show, don't tell</h3>
    <p>
      Creating a visual or small animation showing an idea is better than
      writing a few paragraphs about it. If you have an idea about a cool new
      way to transfer photos between phones, such as making an animation or even
      filming a video. Showcase your idea rather than explaining it in words.
    </p>
    <h3>A long write-up doesn't equal a better project</h3>
    <p>
      Think about if you can get more value out of spending your time improving
      the work over writing a lengthy case study about it.

        Pro tip: Most interviewers will only read through a project for a minute
        or two!
