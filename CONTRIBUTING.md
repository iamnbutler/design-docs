# Contributing to Design Docs

Welcome! We would love to have you here to contribute to open design resources and education.

## How you can contribute

- You can report any issues you encounter, or add design & engineering sugestions in an Issue.
- Take a look at the TODO section on the Readme, or take a look at the issues board and see if there is anything you might be able to contribute.

## Contributing without Github

Not comfortable using Github but want to contribute content, links, review a section or give feedback? You can email Nate Butler at iamnbutler$$$$(at)gmail(dotcom). (Remove the $s and it is a regular gmail address.)
